## Self-hosting Reven
You can run Reven locally without having to install it from the Chrome Store. Here's how:

1. Download the code. In the web version of GitHub, you can do that by clicking the green "Code" button, and then "Download ZIP".
2. Go to chrome://extensions/ in your browser, and [enable developer mode](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv2/faq/#:~:text=You%20can%20start%20by%20turning,a%20packaged%20extension%2C%20and%20more.).
3. Drag the folder that contains the code (make sure it's a folder and not a ZIP file, so unzip first), or click on the "Load unpacked" button and locate the folder.
4. That's it, you will now be able to use Reven locally. Make sure you pin it on the toolbar by clicking the "puzzle" icon in the toolbar and pinning Reven.
